# Hurricane Camp

### What is hurricane dev camp?
Since many of us will be trapped inside this weekend due to Hurricane Irene, hurricane dev camp is a hackathon to work on your side projects, since what else are you going to do really? Perhaps we will be inspired to work on weather / disaster relief related projects, but it's not mandatory.

### Where does hurricane dev camp take place?
In your own home, presuming you have working power and internet.

### What do I need to participate?

 * Your computer and dev environment of choice.
 * Working power and internet.
 * Enough food, water, and supplies to last the storm. Please see http://nyc.gov or your local city's informational site for safety instructions.

### Who's behind this?
No one really. The idea came from @jennjenn and @mroth.
