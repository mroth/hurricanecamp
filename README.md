### What is hurricane dev camp?
Hurricane Dev Camp is a "stay-at-home hackathon."  Since many of us will be trapped inside this weekend due to Hurricane Irene, this is group collaboration / motivating effort to work on your side projects, or start a new one... since what else are you going to do really? Hopefully we will be inspired to work on weather / disaster relief related projects, but it's not mandatory.

### Where does hurricane dev camp take place?
In your own home, presuming you have working power and internet.  Group collaboration will be done ad-hoc and via whatever internet communication tools we have available.

### What do I need to participate?

 * Your computer and dev environment of choice.
 * Working power and internet.
 * Enough food, water, and supplies to last the storm. Please see http://nyc.gov or your local city's informational site for safety instructions.

### What if I live in an area not affected by Hurricane Irene?
You're certainly welcome to participate anyhow!  Although if the weather is :sunny: where you are, you might want to consider going outside instead. 

### Who's behind this?
No one really. The idea came from [@jennjenn](http://twitter.com/jennjenn) and [@mroth](http://twitter.com/mroth).
